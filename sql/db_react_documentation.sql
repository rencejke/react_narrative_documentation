On-the-job training allows you to learn by doing, right at the workplace, guided by a supervisor, manager, or an experienced colleague.\n\nWhen you undergo this type of training, you gain firsthand experience with the daily activities and operations you’ll encounter in your new role. You’ll learn about workplace expectations, how to operate essential equipment, and acquire other crucial skills needed to succeed in your job.', '2024-05-29', 1, '2024-05-30 07:29:58', '2024-05-29 13:01:43');

Detailed discussion of what you do every day.**\n\n| Day| Work Discussion |\n| :---: | :---: |\n|   &emsp; 1   | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  On this day, I have an orientation &#160; about our OJT. Our instructor &#160; discusses the psychology of UI and UX, their concepts them, etc. My instructor tasks me with creating an asset and logo using Figma. I learned today how to use it and how to create an asset using it. In that way, it will make the design journey in Figma much easier. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  |\n|   &emsp; 2   | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  On this day, I created a sample website design that my trainer wanted me to copy. He teaches me various techniques for creating animations and makes things easier in Figma. I finished creating the sample website design. He also taught us how to make a slide in Figma.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  |\n|   &emsp; 3   | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  On this day, our trainer instructed us to create our portfolio design in Figma. I initially created the design, but upon reflection, I decided to redo it, as I felt it might not meet the required design standards. Our trainer also taught us how to incorporate new animations into our designs using Figma. I didnt complete my design during the session as I wanted to refine it further. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  |\n|   &emsp; 4   | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  On this day, we continued our design work until 8 a.m. At that point,  each of us was called to present our work in the conference room. Before being called, I was in the process of making revisions to my design. I was eventually called at 1:30+ pm. During my presentation, I showcased and explained the decisions behind my design. After the presentation, they provided me with suggestions and recommendations on how to enhance and improve my design &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  |\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  **B. New Experiences**\n\n&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Being in the first week of my OJT I experienced many things, first I \nlearned how to properly use Figma, second work under pressure, presented my work in the conference room, and lastly I received constructive feedback on my work that will improve and enhance my design.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  **C. Skills and knowledge areas that you need to improve**\n\n&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; During the first week of my OJT, I gained many valuable experiences. Firstly, I learned how to effectively use Figma. Secondly, I acquired the skill of working under pressure, especially when presenting my work in the conference room. Lastly, I received constructive feedback on my work, which will contribute to the improvement and enhancement of my design.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  **D. Plans for improving your performance**\n\n&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; I plan to watch video tutorials about design principles and proper color usage. Additionally, I intend to engage in design practice to enhance my muscle memory. To further my learning, I will join a design community on Facebook, allowing me to connect with others and seek advice on my designs\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  **E. Situations you observed during the week that were interesting and might be helpful to you in your professional development.**\n\n&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; I observed how my colleague was working on our task, paying attention to his methods and how he handled it. He is good at communication and excels in designing. This observation made me realize that I should further enhance my skills\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  **F. Summary Statement**\n\n&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; During the first week of my On-the-Job training, we were assigned numerous tasks to practice and improve our design skills using Figma. I acquired a multitude of techniques in Figma and gained a better understanding of its proper usage. The trainers here are all good and they are always smiling. Whenever I or my colleague have a question about a certain task our trainer will go to them quickly and guide them', '2024-05-30', 1, '2024-05-30 13:47:31', '2024-05-30 12:39:58'),

Detailed discussion of what you do every day.**\n\n| Day| Work Discussion |\n| :---: | :---: |\n|   &emsp; 1   | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  On this day, our instructor tasks us with creating our version of the  San Pablo Colleges (SPC) website design in Figma. Our instructor  formed us into three groups to practice collaboration with others. I collaborate with my two colleagues; we ask each other what designs should or shouldn’t do. We assigned what web page each of us will do, and if there are changes, we will just change it later on. The  problem here is that we have different ideas, and our ideas are fighting. For example, for me, this design is good, but for my colleague, it’s not. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  |\n|   &emsp; 2   | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  On this day, we continue the collaboration of designing our own style of SPC website. We are finding references on Pinterest and many  other websites to improve our design. We finished our design of the SPC website today&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  |\n|   &emsp; 3   | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On this day, we need to present or redesign the SPC website to Sir Jhonny and Sir Roy. We are group 3 here, and I’m so nervous  because we will explain it in front of them. After presenting our  redesign website, Sir Jhonny and Sir Roy praised our work and  pointed out the weaknesses and strengths of our design. They told us what things we needed to improve and consider when designing a website. This day, we start our basic HTML and CSS coding. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  |\n|   &emsp; 4   | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  On this day, we continue our practice of HTML and CSS. We are cloning some web pages that our instructor assigned us to do. We are copying those designs by using HTML and CSS. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  |\n|   &emsp; 5  | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  On this day, we continue our coding of other web pages of the website that we need to copy. Our instructor gave us the challenge that the catalog page images and text should swap places when a new class is added without renaming the class or editing the added class in CSS. I finished this challenge. We also do this day JavaScript and responsive website design. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  |\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  **B. New Experiences**\n\n&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; This week my workmate and I collaborated on designing San Pablo \nColleges website in Figma. We faced challenges as our ideas clashed, but through discussions and references, we completed the redesign website. We nervously present our redesign website to our instructor; we received feedback about the strengths and weaknesses of our design. We moved to HTML, and CSS as the next topic, and I even solved a challenge this week like swapping images and text dynamically using only one class.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  **C. Skills and knowledge areas that you need to improve**\n\n&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; I noticed that there are many skills and knowledge that I need to improve \nbased in this week collaboration with my workmates. I identified that I need to \nenhance my collaboration skills and effective communication. As our group faced \ndifferent opinions about design ideas, I realized the importance of aligning thoughts \nto ensure a smooth experience within the team. I need to improve my adaptability \nto different ideas within a team to be more flexible next time. Also, I need to \nimprove my responsive design.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  **D. Plans for improving your performance**\n\n&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; I plan to get better at working in a team by talking more about our ideas to find common ideas and align our thoughts. I’ll check out different websites and I will try to use those ideas in my work. I will spend more time practicing and learning HTML, and CSS to get really good at it and to become a good website designer and developer.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  **E. Situations you observed during the week that were interesting and might be helpful to you in your professional development.**\n\n&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;This week, I saw interesting things that could help me in my professional development. Working on a project within a team was cool because we have different ideas. It taught me that listening to everyone’s opinion is important, and finding common ideas makes things get better and smoother. I also liked this week challenge, like swapping images and text without changing in HTML, and CSS.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  **F. Summary Statement**\n\n&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; This week is all about designing a website with my team using Figma, and it was challenging because we had different ideas. We presented our designs to our instructors, we got feedback and learned what is the strength of our design and what are the things needs to improve.

Detailed discussion of what you do every day.**\n\n| Day| Work Discussion |\n| :---: | :---: |\n|   &emsp; 1   | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  On this day, we continue practicing web design by implementing grids or flexboxes. I learned the differences and advantages between the two. I easily understand the grid, but I have a problem learning Flexbox. We created the update and contact us page that our instructor assigned us to do. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  |\n|   &emsp; 2   | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   On this day, we continue practicing using flexbox and grid. This is the last day for our basic HTML and CSS, and tomorrow we will start SASS (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets). I learned a lot from our  7-day practice of HTML and CSS, like using Emmet and BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) and the proper and clean way of coding in HTML and CSS. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  |\n|   &emsp; 3   | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On this day, we start working on SASS. I love this new topic, but it’s quite confusing because one error can make your HTML and CSS  not work. It’s so sensitive. We discuss variables, partial (fragmentation), and inheritance today. Before we start coding our very first SASS, we modify the settings in VScode. We created a mobile version of MCDO today using SASS.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  |\n|   &emsp; 4   | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On this day, we continue practicing SASS by copying MCDO web pages. Our instructor introduced the mixin feature of SASS. We created a lot of mixins and utilities in SASS, and we applied this feature to the MCDO web pages that we are copying today.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  |\n|   &emsp; 5  | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  On this day, we continue practicing SASS by copying some of the web pages of MCDO. Also this day, we copied a portfolio web page from Pinterest together with our instructor using SASS that we’ve learned &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  |\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  **B. New Experiences**\n\n&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; I learned about creating web layouts using grid and flexbox. Grid was easy to understand but flexbox is quite confusing to me. We finished HTML, and CSS lessons and moved to SASS. SASS is like a fancier and organized way of styling but its quite sensitive.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  **C. Skills and knowledge areas that you need to improve**\n\n&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Based on this week learning experiences, I’ve noticed some areas that \nI need to improve. I noticed that I have a good grasp of grid layouts but its opposite \nto flexbox. SASS is challenging too to learn because of its sensitivity. Small errors \ncan make your HTML, and CSS not work.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  **D. Plans for improving your performance**\n\n&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; I plan to download a pdf file of a cheat sheet of Flexbox and watch \ntutorials to strengthen my understanding and get better at it. When it comes to \nSASS, I’ll pay close attention to debugging and error messages of SASS to easily \nlocate what is the problem.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  **E. Situations you observed during the week that were interesting and might be helpful to you in your professional development.**\n\n&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; I noticed some situations that can help me in my professional \ndevelopment. First is the practical use of Grid and Flexbox. Seeing how these web \nlayouts work will help me in my future projects. This week also taught me to pay closer attention to every details of my code to prevent errors or bugs, and practicing \ncan help me get better at making websites.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  **F. Summary Statement**\n\n&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; This week is all about practicing web design and coding practices. SASS \nare good for organize styling but confusing.

When we are coding the web pages, our instructor codes with us and guides us when we are experiencing problems. After we finish creating the blog web pages, we move on to our  first grade project, which is the gym website from Behance. I face some problems because of the design. It doesn’t show the thing that I coded. But before we went home, I managed to find the problem.\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  |\n|   &emsp; 2   | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   On this day, we continued creating the gym website, and I finished it before the deadline ended. I think because of this, I have a good grasp of SASS, but yes, I have a long way to go before I can learn it all. In the afternoon, our instructor graded our work, and after he graded our work, he coded the gym website to show us the way he coded and to show us what the problems were. After he was done coding, he sent our next graded project, which is a food website that we will do tomorrow. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  |\n|   &emsp; 3   | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On this day, we continued practicing SASS by copying a food website that our instructor assigned us to do. We also need it to make it responsive. I finished it much easier than before, I believe because I have a good grasp on SASS and my muscle memory is being practiced. Like yesterday, our instructor graded our work, and after that, he coded the graded project to show us how he coded every part of the web page. Before we go home, our instructor sends us the grade that we will do tomorrow, which is a car website. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  |\n|   &emsp; 4   | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On this day, we continue practicing SASS by copying a car website. I faced some challenges here because the tiny slider, a JS library that we use to have a slider on our website, is not working, but I managed to fix it by scanning the whole HTML with the help of our instructor. This is the last day of our SASS, and I learned a lot from our 8 days of practicing SASS. By Monday, we will move on to tailwind a CSS framework, and I’m really excited to learn it today. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  |\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  **B. New Experiences**\n\n&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; This week we worked on a lot of websites. It’s a bit tricky and challenging, but I managed to do it.

Detailed discussion of what you do every day.**\n\n| Day| Work Discussion |\n| :---: | :---: |\n|   &emsp; 1   | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Today is the beginning of our Tailwind lesson and I’m excited about it because I’ll learn new things and have new experiences. We’re copying the home page of Starbucks using Tailwind. I had a problem with handling errors because of how Tailwind works. It feels a bit like SASS Where a tiny mistake can make your CSS not work. But I fixed the problem I ran into today. The task that we did today is graded. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  |\n|   &emsp; 2   | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Today, we continued copying the specific web page of Starbucks. We copied the links, footer, and reward page of Starbucks. Our instructor assigned us to recreate a specific section of Starbucks, which will be graded like yesterday. Additionally, our instructor tasked us with polishing the home page and all the copied parts of Starbucks because they’ll be graded.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  |\n|   &emsp; 3   | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This day we started another task assigned by our instructor. Yesterday, he sent us the task for today in a video format to prevent us from inspecting it. He explained that in the industry, only the design is given to the web developers, and relying and abusing too much on inspecting elements can affect our decisions when it comes to building the actual websites. I was able to complete most of the parts of the web page, but I faced a problem with adding hover effects to the project section of Insight. I finished the mobile version and some parts of the Insights in the Desktop version. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  |\n|   &emsp; 4   | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This day, we continue doing the Insight web page. I am doing the  desktop part of Insight and polishing it. I submitted the given task before 11 a.m. After lunch, we do another task that we need to do, which is the FCA FAQs page, which is kind of hard because it is a combination of the tabs and drop-down links that we do at Starbucks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  |\n|   &emsp; 5   | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This day, we continued working on the FAQs web page of FCA, and I completed the desktop version of this page. Im so happy that I finished all of the designs, including the FAQs page, and it is working properly. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  |\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  **B. New Experiences**\n\n&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; In our Tailwind lesson, I learned new things and faced problems, like \nfixing errors similar to working with SASS. We copied parts of the Starbucks website and even recreated some sections of it. Additionally, we worked on the FAQs page for FCA, and the Insight Page completing both mobile and desktop \nversions successfully.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  **C. Skills and knowledge areas that you need to improve**\n\n&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; I need to improve my skills in handling errors when using Tailwind. I want to enhance my understanding of creating hover effects on Tailwind because it is so confusing and I encountered difficulties using it while working on the Insight web page. Additionally, I want to strengthen my understanding of JavaScript DOM.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  **D. Plans for improving your performance**\n\n&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; I plan to dedicate more time to practicing Tailwind to understand it better. I will also spend time reading the documentation of Tailwind to properly use the utility classes. Also, I plan to convert some of my old projects into Tailwind to enhance my skills and performance.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  **E. Situations you observed during the week that were interesting and might be helpful to you in your professional development.**\n\n&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; I observed how important attention to detail is when copying a website web pages. I also learned that I shouldn’t rely on and don’t abuse Inspecting elements because it can interfere with my decision-making on websites.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  **F. Summary Statement**\n\n&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Throughout this week, I completed various projects that involved copying certain web pages using Tailwind CSS. These hands-on activities allowed me to identify different areas for improvement and the activities that I did this week  have enhanced my skills in website design.', '2024-05-30', 1, '2024-05-30 14:34:13', '2024-05-30 14:30:32'),

I did the home page today, and I did the website and mobile version of it. I faced some minor problems, like the positioning of images and the navigation bar. I’m so glad that I managed to solve my problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  |\n|   &emsp; 2   | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   We continue today our practice of Tailwind by copying two pages of the Frontline website, which are the Home page and the About Us page.

I’m so glad that I managed to solve my problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  |\n|   &emsp; 3   | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This day I polished some parts of the home page and about us at Frontline, and I passed it before 2 p.m. because we will have a company fellowship, which Frontline does every month. I’m so thankful that we were included in and experienced this kind of event. We trainees are being separated into different groups, and I am being grouped with my previous instructors, current instructors, two of my workmates, and another employee of Frontline. This fellowship event prepared a game for us in which each person in our specific group will tell and act with emotion on a specific line of a character from a specific movie, and we will tell who said the line and our group won, and the best actor will also come from our group. We also eat together. This day is so tiring, but so great. I’m so thankful for this day. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  |\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  **B. New Experiences**\n\n&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Participating in the company fellowship at Frontline give me new experiences such as working with other colleagues and engaging in a fun game activity with them, making this week tiring and rewarding.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  **C. Skills and knowledge areas that you need to improve**\n\n&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; I realized I still need to improve my website design skills with positioning images and navigation bars. I think understanding and reviewing Tailwind and JavaScript will help me to solve these problems much easier and faster. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  **D. Plans for improving your performance**\n\n&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; To enhance my experience I plan to regularly practice, focusing on troubleshooting some issues like image positioning and the navigation bar. I also plan to seek guidance from my experienced workmates and online resources to deepen my understanding of Tailwind and web development.\n&nbsp;\n\n&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  **E. Situations you observed during the week that were interesting and might be helpful to you in your professional development.**\n\n&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; I noticed how breaking down tasks into smaller and manageable steps help my colleagues stay organized and efficient. This can be very helpful for me in handling complex projects in the future.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  **F.

Detailed discussion of what you do every day.**\n\n| Day| Work Discussion |\n| :---: | :---: |\n|   &emsp; 1   | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  This day, our instructor was teaching us some WordPress, and he announced that we would do a group task. We will copy a specific web page from the list provided by our instructor. We are being grouped into 5 groups, and the selection of these is via an online spin wheel. The specific design that we will also copy is a spin wheel too, so our group selection and the web pages that we will copy are random. We also practiced doing some group collaboration on Github today under the guidance of our instructor. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  |\n|   &emsp; 2   | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Now I do the specific page that I was assigned by our leader, which is the home page. I managed to finish some parts of the home page in the mobile version today. I’m so careful when doing some things in CSS because if I remove or change some part of our CSS that is not part of my page, their design will be affected. I am also careful when pushing my work in our repositories because my work only needs to be pushed in my branch and not in other branches where our leader (master) is created. Before we go home, our leader merges our work, and thankfully, our work doesn’t have issues.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  |\n|   &emsp; 3   | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today we continue doing our task. I completed all the parts of the home page in mobile, tablet, and desktop versions. I faced some issues in using the JS library, which is particle.js. I managed to solve the fact that it’s not showing on my home page, but I don’t yet know why it shows under a section where I put it. It should be in the background, not under a section &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  |\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  **B. New Experiences**\n\n&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; I learned how to use WordPress and collaborated with my team on a group task. It was my first time using Github for group work, which was interesting. Despite some challenges with CSS and JavaScript, I made progress on the home \npage task.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  **C. Skills and knowledge areas that you need to improve**\n\n&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; I want to become more proficient in using JavaScript libraries like particle.js. Furthermore, I aim to enhance my teamwork skills, especially in collaborating on projects using platforms like Github\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  **D. Plans for improving your performance**\n\n&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; To enhance my performance I plan to dedicate more time to practicing JavaScript regularly. I will also find tutorials to deepen my understanding of JavaScript. Additionally, I plan to participate in more collaborative projects in the future to improve my teamwork skills and become more proficient in using platforms in collaborative projects like Github.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  **E. Situations you observed during the week that were interesting and might be helpful to you in your professional development.**\n\n&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; I observed the importance of teamwork and effective collaboration on Github during our group task. Seeing how we used Github to save and share our work showed how it helped us work better together. It makes sure everyone has the same version of our project, making things smoother and more organized.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  **F. Summary Statement**\n\n&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; During this week, I gained valuable experience in WordPress and collaborated effectively with my team on a group task.
