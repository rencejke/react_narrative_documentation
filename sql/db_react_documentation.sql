On-the-job training allows you to learn by doing, right at the workplace, guided by a supervisor, manager, or an experienced colleague.\n\nWhen you undergo this type of training, you gain firsthand experience with the daily activities and operations you’ll encounter in your new role. You’ll learn about workplace expectations, how to operate essential equipment, and acquire other crucial skills needed to succeed in your job.', '2024-05-29', 1, '2024-05-30 07:29:58', '2024-05-29 13:01:43');

Detailed discussion of what you do every day.**\n\n| Day| Work Discussion |\n| --- | --- |\n|   &emsp; 1   | On this day, I have an orientation &#160; about our OJT. Our instructor &#160; discusses the psychology of UI and UX, their concepts them, etc. My instructor tasks me with creating an asset and logo using Figma. I learned today how to use it and how to create an asset using it. In that way, it will make the design journey in Figma much easier.  |\n|   &emsp; 2   |On this day, I created a sample website design that my trainer wanted me to copy. He teaches me various techniques for creating animations and makes things easier in Figma. I finished creating the sample website design. He also taught us how to make a slide in Figma.  |\n|   &emsp; 3   | On this day, our trainer instructed us to create our portfolio design in Figma. I initially created the design, but upon reflection, I decided to redo it, as I felt it might not meet the required design standards. Our trainer also taught us how to incorporate new animations into our designs using Figma. I didnt complete my design during the session as I wanted to refine it further. |\n|   &emsp; 4   |  On this day, we continued our design work until 8 a.m. At that point,  each of us was called to present our work in the conference room. Before being called, I was in the process of making revisions to my design. I was eventually called at 1:30+ pm. During my presentation, I showcased and explained the decisions behind my design. After the presentation, they provided me with suggestions and recommendations on how to enhance and improve my design  |\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  **B. New Experiences**\n\n&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Being in the first week of my OJT I experienced many things, first I \nlearned how to properly use Figma, second work under pressure, presented my work in the conference room, and lastly I received constructive feedback on my work that will improve and enhance my design.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  **C.

Plans for improving your performance**\n\n&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; I plan to watch video tutorials about design principles and proper color usage. Additionally, I intend to engage in design practice to enhance my muscle memory. To further my learning, I will join a design community on Facebook, allowing me to connect with others and seek advice on my designs\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  **E. Situations you observed during the week that were interesting and might be helpful to you in your professional development.**\n\n&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; I observed how my colleague was working on our task, paying attention to his methods and how he handled it. He is good at communication and excels in designing. This observation made me realize that I should further enhance my skills\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  **F.

Our instructor  formed us into three groups to practice collaboration with others. I collaborate with my two colleagues; we ask each other what designs should or shouldn’t do. We assigned what web page each of us will do, and if there are changes, we will just change it later on. The  problem here is that we have different ideas, and our ideas are fighting. For example, for me, this design is good, but for my colleague, it’s not.   |\n|   &emsp; 2   |   On this day, we continue the collaboration of designing our own style of SPC website. We are finding references on Pinterest and many  other websites to improve our design. We finished our design of the SPC website today |\n|   &emsp; 3   |  On this day, we need to present or redesign the SPC website to Sir Jhonny and Sir Roy. We are group 3 here, and I’m so nervous  because we will explain it in front of them. After presenting our  redesign website, Sir Jhonny and Sir Roy praised our work and  pointed out the weaknesses and strengths of our design. They told us what things we needed to improve and consider when designing a website. This day, we start our basic HTML and CSS coding.   |\n|   &emsp; 4   |   On this day, we continue our practice of HTML and CSS. We are cloning some web pages that our instructor assigned us to do. We are copying those designs by using HTML and CSS.   |\n|   &emsp; 5  |  On this day, we continue our coding of other web pages of the website that we need to copy. Our instructor gave us the challenge that the catalog page images and text should swap places when a new class is added without renaming the class or editing the added class in CSS. I finished this challenge. We also do this day JavaScript and responsive website design.  |\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  **B. New Experiences**\n\n&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; This week my workmate and I collaborated on designing San Pablo \nColleges website in Figma. We faced challenges as our ideas clashed, but through discussions and references, we completed the redesign website. We nervously present our redesign website to our instructor; we received feedback about the strengths and weaknesses of our design. We moved to HTML, and CSS as the next topic, and I even solved a challenge this week like swapping images and text dynamically using only one class.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  **C. Skills and knowledge areas that you need to improve**\n\n&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; I noticed that there are many skills and knowledge that I need to improve \nbased in this week collaboration with my workmates. I identified that I need to \nenhance my collaboration skills and effective communication. As our group faced \ndifferent opinions about design ideas, I realized the importance of aligning thoughts \nto ensure a smooth experience within the team. I need to improve my adaptability \nto different ideas within a team to be more flexible next time. Also, I need to \nimprove my responsive design.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  **D. Plans for improving your performance**\n\n&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; I plan to get better at working in a team by talking more about our ideas to find common ideas and align our thoughts. I’ll check out different websites and I will try to use those ideas in my work. I will spend more time practicing and learning HTML, and CSS to get really good at it and to become a good website designer and developer.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  **E. Situations you observed during the week that were interesting and might be helpful to you in your professional development.**\n\n&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;This week, I saw interesting things that could help me in my professional development. Working on a project within a team was cool because we have different ideas. It taught me that listening to everyone’s opinion is important, and finding common ideas makes things get better and smoother.

Detailed discussion of what you do every day.**\n\n| Day| Work Discussion |\n| :---: | :---: |\n|   &emsp; 1   | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  On this day, we continue practicing web design by implementing grids or flexboxes. I learned the differences and advantages between the two. I easily understand the grid, but I have a problem learning Flexbox. We created the update and contact us page that our instructor assigned us to do. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  |\n|   &emsp; 2   | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   On this day, we continue practicing using flexbox and grid. This is the last day for our basic HTML and CSS, and tomorrow we will start SASS (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets). I learned a lot from our  7-day practice of HTML and CSS, like using Emmet and BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) and the proper and clean way of coding in HTML and CSS. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  |\n|   &emsp; 3   | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On this day, we start working on SASS. I love this new topic, but it’s quite confusing because one error can make your HTML and CSS  not work. It’s so sensitive. We discuss variables, partial (fragmentation), and inheritance today. Before we start coding our very first SASS, we modify the settings in VScode. We created a mobile version of MCDO today using SASS.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  |\n|   &emsp; 4   | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On this day, we continue practicing SASS by copying MCDO web pages. Our instructor introduced the mixin feature of SASS. We created a lot of mixins and utilities in SASS, and we applied this feature to the MCDO web pages that we are copying today.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  |\n|   &emsp; 5  | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  On this day, we continue practicing SASS by copying some of the web pages of MCDO. Also this day, we copied a portfolio web page from Pinterest together with our instructor using SASS that we’ve learned &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  |\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  **B. New Experiences**\n\n&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; I learned about creating web layouts using grid and flexbox. Grid was easy to understand but flexbox is quite confusing to me. We finished HTML, and CSS lessons and moved to SASS. SASS is like a fancier and organized way of styling but its quite sensitive.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  **C. Skills and knowledge areas that you need to improve**\n\n&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Based on this week learning experiences, I’ve noticed some areas that \nI need to improve. I noticed that I have a good grasp of grid layouts but its opposite \nto flexbox. SASS is challenging too to learn because of its sensitivity. Small errors \ncan make your HTML, and CSS not work.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  **D. Plans for improving your performance**\n\n&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; I plan to download a pdf file of a cheat sheet of Flexbox and watch \ntutorials to strengthen my understanding and get better at it. When it comes to \nSASS, I’ll pay close attention to debugging and error messages of SASS to easily \nlocate what is the problem.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  **E. Situations you observed during the week that were interesting and might be helpful to you in your professional development.**\n\n&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; I noticed some situations that can help me in my professional \ndevelopment. First is the practical use of Grid and Flexbox. Seeing how these web \nlayouts work will help me in my future projects. This week also taught me to pay closer attention to every details of my code to prevent errors or bugs, and practicing \ncan help me get better at making websites.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  **F. Summary Statement**\n\n&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; This week is all about practicing web design and coding practices. SASS \nare good for organize styling but confusing.

When we are coding the web pages, our instructor codes with us and guides us when we are experiencing problems. After we finish creating the blog web pages, we move on to our  first grade project, which is the gym website from Behance. I face some problems because of the design.

After he was done coding, he sent our next graded project, which is a food website that we will do tomorrow. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  |\n|   &emsp; 3   | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On this day, we continued practicing SASS by copying a food website that our instructor assigned us to do. We also need it to make it responsive. I finished it much easier than before, I believe because I have a good grasp on SASS and my muscle memory is being practiced. Like yesterday, our instructor graded our work, and after that, he coded the graded project to show us how he coded every part of the web page. Before we go home, our instructor sends us the grade that we will do tomorrow, which is a car website. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  |\n|   &emsp; 4   | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On this day, we continue practicing SASS by copying a car website. I faced some challenges here because the tiny slider, a JS library that we use to have a slider on our website, is not working, but I managed to fix it by scanning the whole HTML with the help of our instructor. This is the last day of our SASS, and I learned a lot from our 8 days of practicing SASS. By Monday, we will move on to tailwind a CSS framework, and I’m really excited to learn it today. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  |\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  **B. New Experiences**\n\n&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; This week we worked on a lot of websites. It’s a bit tricky and challenging, but I managed to do it. I’m finally having a good grasp on SASS because of our project and the activities that we have done these past few days. Next week, I\\\'m excited to start learning Tailwind CSS for even more website design and web development skills.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  **C. Skills and knowledge areas that you need to improve**\n\n&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; I need to get better at coding with SASS and fixing website design problems.

We’re copying the home page of Starbucks using Tailwind. I had a problem with handling errors because of how Tailwind works. It feels a bit like SASS Where a tiny mistake can make your CSS not work. But I fixed the problem I ran into today. The task that we did today is graded. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  |\n|   &emsp; 2   | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Today, we continued copying the specific web page of Starbucks. We copied the links, footer, and reward page of Starbucks. Our instructor assigned us to recreate a specific section of Starbucks, which will be graded like yesterday. Additionally, our instructor tasked us with polishing the home page and all the copied parts of Starbucks because they’ll be graded.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  |\n|   &emsp; 3   | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This day we started another task assigned by our instructor. Yesterday, he sent us the task for today in a video format to prevent us from inspecting it. He explained that in the industry, only the design is given to the web developers, and relying and abusing too much on inspecting elements can affect our decisions when it comes to building the actual websites. I was able to complete most of the parts of the web page, but I faced a problem with adding hover effects to the project section of Insight. I finished the mobile version and some parts of the Insights in the Desktop version. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  |\n|   &emsp; 4   | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This day, we continue doing the Insight web page. I am doing the  desktop part of Insight and polishing it. I submitted the given task before 11 a.m. After lunch, we do another task that we need to do, which is the FCA FAQs page, which is kind of hard because it is a combination of the tabs and drop-down links that we do at Starbucks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  |\n|   &emsp; 5   | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This day, we continued working on the FAQs web page of FCA, and I completed the desktop version of this page. Im so happy that I finished all of the designs, including the FAQs page, and it is working properly. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  |\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  **B. New Experiences**\n\n&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; In our Tailwind lesson, I learned new things and faced problems, like \nfixing errors similar to working with SASS. We copied parts of the Starbucks website and even recreated some sections of it. Additionally, we worked on the FAQs page for FCA, and the Insight Page completing both mobile and desktop \nversions successfully.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  **C. Skills and knowledge areas that you need to improve**\n\n&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; I need to improve my skills in handling errors when using Tailwind. I want to enhance my understanding of creating hover effects on Tailwind because it is so confusing and I encountered difficulties using it while working on the Insight web page. Additionally, I want to strengthen my understanding of JavaScript DOM.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  **D. Plans for improving your performance**\n\n&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; I plan to dedicate more time to practicing Tailwind to understand it better. I will also spend time reading the documentation of Tailwind to properly use the utility classes. Also, I plan to convert some of my old projects into Tailwind to enhance my skills and performance.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  **E.

We will copy a specific web page from the list provided by our instructor. We are being grouped into 5 groups, and the selection of these is via an online spin wheel. The specific design that we will also copy is a spin wheel too, so our group selection and the web pages that we will copy are random. We also practiced doing some group collaboration on Github today under the guidance of our instructor. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  |\n|   &emsp; 2   | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Now I do the specific page that I was assigned by our leader, which is the home page. I managed to finish some parts of the home page in the mobile version today. I’m so careful when doing some things in CSS because if I remove or change some part of our CSS that is not part of my page, their design will be affected. I am also careful when pushing my work in our repositories because my work only needs to be pushed in my branch and not in other branches where our leader (master) is created. Before we go home, our leader merges our work, and thankfully, our work doesn’t have issues.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  |\n|   &emsp; 3   | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today we continue doing our task.

Our instructor guided us through setting up our React project folder and today we started working on recreating the Starbucks website using React. We learned about using props in React, which was a bit confusing at first because passing data between different components seemed tricky. We also tackled mapping data, which is like looping in other programming languages. I faced challenges dealing with bugs and errors, as my code wasn\\\'t showing up in my browser initially, but I\\\'m happy to say I managed to fix it. |\n|   &emsp; 2   | Today, we continued working on the Starbucks website and added some new functions to it. For example, when users click on a menu picture, a modal pops up. We also add an add to cart function within the modal, and finally, we added a feature to calculate the price in the add to cart using React. Also, we learned how to use the useState hook. Today had its challenges, especially with the combination of props and useState, and React\\\'s sensitivity to errors. Even a small mistake can prevent your code from displaying correctly in the browser  |\n|   &emsp; 3   |  Today, we began another project in React, creating a copy of the Netflix website. We copied certain elements and converted them to React components, focusing on the landing page and login page. During this process, I learned how to use the ternary operator in React. However, I still encountered challenges, particularly with understanding the usage of props and useState in React Today, we continued working on our React Netflix project, focusing on the movie page. We add modals and passed data between different components. Also, we added modal functionalities and used a slider library for React. One interesting thing we learned was how to display specific sliders based on a category in the data,js.  Although I encountered some problems, I was able to fixed them |\n|   &emsp; 4   |  Today, we continued working on our React Netflix project, focusing  on the movie page.

After, we presented our WordPress project, which had been postponed due to an error last week. Once the presentation was done, we packed our things and headed to our second company fellowship. I was excited to meet new people and enjoy playing and eating together. Upon arrival, we took pictures with our supervisor before the fellowship started. We began with the employee of the month awards, followed by grouping into six teams for pasahan bola game. I was excited to participate and even happier when my team won 2nd place, earning us chocolates as a prize. After the games, we all sat down to enjoy a delicious meal together. After we eat, we moved on to the last part of the fellowship. We regrouped and shared our highs and lows with each other, which helped us feel more connected. It was a very happy day, and I\\\'m thankful for the experience. |\n|   &emsp; 6   |  Today starts the beginning of my Saturday class. My instructor gave me an activity which is converting our ramen website into React. I had to apply what I\\\'ve learned to this task. Although I encountered some problems, I managed to fix them. I found myself resolving bugs and errors faster than before. This has shown me that my skills in React are growing. |\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  **B.

Utilizing the skills I\\\'ve acquired over the past few months, I successfully recreated the YouTube homepage today.|\n|   &emsp; 2   | Today, I just finished polishing my cloned YouTube project. Since it\\\'s due for grading today, I double checked all the details and data mappings to ensure the details are correct. My instructor will be assessing our projects at 12 pm, so I feel relieved to have completed mine. Additionally, we\\\'re beginning a new project today which is creating a school dashboard.  |\n|   &emsp; 3   |  Today, we kept working on our school dashboard project. We focused on its design and added some features. For example, we made it so that if you double click a row, it shows some information about the user. Right now, it\\\'s not getting data from the database. We finished the design and added some features to the dashboard. After we were done, I pushed the project on my GitHub. |\n|   &emsp; 4   | Today, we continued our school dashboard project, and our instructor introduced us to Formik, TanStack, and Yup. Formik helps in building forms, offering features like error handling, validation, and submissions. TanStack is for managing API requests, and Yup is a JavaScript library for form validation. We also started working on our API today, which was a bit confusing. Our instructor also showed us the Thunder Client extension, which lets us test our API, helping us spot any issues. I learned a lot today and gained up new skills and knowledge. |\n|   &emsp; 5   |  Today, I created the API for Netflix, setting up new tables, controllers, and a database for each data category within Netflix. After completing all the necessary components for the API, I proceeded to test it using the Thunder Client extension. However, during the testing phase, I encountered issues with my API. Through Thunder Client\\\'s error, I learned about the specific problems and errors I was facing, such as forgetting to input the Authentication key and forgetting to update some information in the API. Despite these problems, I managed to finish my tasks and learned a lot of things. |\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  **B.

Detailed discussion of what you do every day.**\n\n| Day| Work Discussion |\n| --- | --- |\n|   &emsp; 1   | Today, we continued working on some parts of the school dashboard, and then we moved on to another project, converting our personal portfolios into React. I completed the banner section, header, and footer of my portfolio today. |\n|   &emsp; 2   | Today, I updated the color and added sections that were missing to my portfolio, such as my projects and experiences. I completed adding all sections today. Additionally, I made some design edits to my portfolio to suit it better with my preferences. After finishing, I pushed the updated project to my GitHub repository. |\n|   &emsp; 3   |  Today, our instructor gave us time to edit parts of our portfolios. After making the necessary changes, we resumed our previous project which is the school dashboard. We implemented CRUD functions, allowing the dashboard to create, read, update, and delete information from the database within the UI. Additionally, we added toast messages to that shows when the CRUD functions are successfully working. I encountered some issues such as the toast messages not appearing and the CRUD functions not functioning properly. With the guidance of our instructor and the assistance of my work mates, I managed to resolve these issues. |\n|   &emsp; 4   | Today, we continued working on our dashboard project. We implemented a search feature and included new inputs in Formik for student gender and email. However, adding new inputs in Formik won\\\'t function properly if the database lacks corresponding columns for this data. So, we updated our REST API code and added new columns to our database to allow these changes. Additionally, our instructor introduced us to a more easy and shortest method of passing data using Store context, reducers, and actions. |\n|   &emsp; 5   |  Today, we started a new project that combines my portfolio with a dashboard. The dashboard helps me edit my portfolio by fetching data from the database. If, for example, I want to change a picture or text on my banner, I can do it through the dashboard. It\\\'s where I manage all my portfolio content. Combining these two projects makes my portfolio more dynamic. I ran into a few small problems while working, but I fixed them quickly. |\n|   &emsp; 6   |  Today, my instructor gave me a task which is to print some sections of my portfolio, like the project we worked on yesterday. I successfully added three sections to my portfolio, and they\\\'re functioning well. The data from my database now appears on my portfolio. When I use CRUD functions on my dashboard, the changes reflect on my portfolio too. Additionally, I added a counter page for each section, showing how many items are in each. While working on the project, I encountered some minor errors, but I managed to fix them. |\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  **B. New Experiences**\n\n&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; I tried something new this week by combining my school dashboard with my personal portfolio, both built in React. It\\\'s my first time combining two projects at once. Additionally, I experienced a new way of doing CRUD this week. Usually, I use PHP directly in my HTML to perform CRUD operations, but this time I gained new knowledge by using a combination of API, React, and PHP.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  **C. Skills and knowledge areas that you need to improve**\n\n&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; I need to improve my knowledge in React, specifically in implementing CRUD operations and integrating API.

I’m so glad that it’s free from it. |\n|   &emsp; 2   | Today, I continued working on my portfolio, and then after some hours, our instructor taught us how to upload images using file types in Formik. Before our teacher introduces this way to us, I upload an image by typing the path of the image in an input field. Our teacher way is much easier, and I don’t need to find the path of my image just to upload it, now I can add any image to my PC and then upload it. I learned new things this day. |\n|   &emsp; 3   | Today, we continue working on our portfolio. I redesigned my whole portfolio because I feel like something is lacking in it.
